    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hello, I’m Korash Assani!
    I am an aspiring astronomer and educator with a lifelong passion for exploring the cosmos and addressing one of humanity’s oldest questions: Where and how did life and our universe originate?
    <p>
    My research journey began at the University of Cincinnati, where I studied how stars and planets form. I used spectroscopic and photometric observations, combined with radiative transfer models of young stellar systems, to investigate the structure and variability of protoplanetary disks—the environments where planets are born.
    </p>
    <p>    
      As a PhD student at the University of Virginia, I have expanded this work by leveraging JWST observations to study protostellar jets and outflows, key processes that shape young stellar systems. My broader interest lies in combining advanced observational techniques with numerical modeling to better understand the environments around newly forming stars. With the rapid advances in computational tools and AI, the future of astronomy promises to be extraordinary, and I am excited to be part of that frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
    Beyond research, I am deeply committed to teaching and mentoring, with the goal of inspiring and supporting the next generation of scientific thinkers. </p>
