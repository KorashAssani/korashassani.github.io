    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Korash Assani — an enthusiastic astronomer, and dedicated educator with a passion for exploring the cosmos. 
        My journey in Astronomy began at the University of Cincinnati, where I worked with Professor Michael Sitko and others to study protoplanetary disks around young protostars. 
        Protoplanetary disks are the birthplace of planets, where collapsing material onto a forming star creates a disk of gas and dust that eventually lead to the formation of solar systems like our own.
        Using observations from optical to radio wavelengths, we'd compare 3-D radiative transfer models to study the physical and dynamical characterisics of these dynamic and evolving systems.
        My passion for the theory and the abstract in relation with the physical sciences led me to pursue a triple major in Astrophysics (BS), Physics (BS), Mathematics (BA)</p>
    <p>Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in Astronomy at the University of Virginia, 
        where my research interests have continued in the star and planet formation studies with Professor Zhi-Yun Li. My recent work leverages cutting-edge JWST observations to study deeply embedded jets and outflows around young forming stars. 
        Protostellar outflows are one of the most spectacular and beautiful signatures of on-going star formation. They transfer angular momentum throughout the protostellar system and eject mass and processed star formation material into the 
    nearby star-forming regions. However, many questions are still unknown regarding these phenomenal cosmic occurances - how exactly are they launched, what are their roles in shaping the dust and gas in the protostellar system, 
why do some protostars have jets and others dont, and many more that I'm interested in. </p>
    <p>Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring the next generation of scientific thinkers.</p>
