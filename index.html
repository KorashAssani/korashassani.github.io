  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>
    I study how stars and planets form, driven by a curiosity about one of humanity’s oldest questions: where and how did life and our universe originate? My research journey began at the University of Cincinnati, where I combined spectroscopic and photometric observations with radiative transfer models to investigate the structure and variability of protoplanetary disks—the environments where planets are born.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a PhD student at the University of Virginia, I now use JWST observations to study protostellar jets and outflows, key processes that shape young stellar systems. More broadly, I integrate advanced observational techniques with numerical modeling to explore the environments around newly forming stars. With rapid advances in computational tools and AI, the future of astronomy offers unprecedented opportunities, and I am excited to help shape that frontier.
  </p>
  <p>
    Teaching and mentorship are equally important to me. I work to inspire and support the next generation of scientific thinkers, both in the classroom and through outreach.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of academics, I’m a father and husband who enjoys gardening, making music, and staying active!
