        <h2>Teaching Statement</h2>
        <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>

        <p>My teaching philosophy is built on the belief that education should ignite curiosity, empower diverse learners, and foster both independent and collaborative problem-solving. 
            I view science and education as transformative tools that inspire us to explore the world, build on generations of knowledge, and pursue freedom and happiness. 
            My prior experiences have shown me that a personalized approach to education can make a significant difference in student engagement and success, and I plan to carry this forward into future teaching roles.</p>

        <p>I have found that hands-on, project-based activities are especially effective in encouraging active participation. 
            In future courses, I plan to design exercises that not only challenge students academically but also help them explore and identify their unique learning styles. 
            For any subject I teach, I aim to incorporate activities that allow students to recognize how they learn best, while also exposing them to diverse perspectives in solving problems. 
            This approach is intended to create a balanced environment where independent thinking and collaboration are both valued.</p>

        <p>Collaborative learning will be a key element of my approach. When students work together on projects, they can solve problems more effectively, communicate their ideas clearly, and appreciate different perspectives. 
            By integrating group projects with opportunities for independent work, I plan to mirror real-world scenarios that require both individual initiative and teamwork. 
            I also intend to incorporate regular, formative assessments and feedback—tools that will allow me to adjust my teaching methods and ensure that every student is progressing in a way that respects their personal strengths and needs. 
            Beyond exams, I envision using collaborative projects and reflective writing to evaluate how students are developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills. 
            I also believe that collaborative and project-based learning will only grow in importance as the use of AI expands both inside and outside the classroom, and I am committed to keeping up with the latest teaching research to adapt my methods and ensure fair and effective evaluation of student learning.</p>

        <p>Inclusivity will remain at the heart of my teaching. I am committed to creating a classroom environment that welcomes students from all backgrounds, tailoring my instructional methods to accommodate a range of learning styles and experiences. 
            Drawing on insights from educational research and my prior experiences, I look forward to refining my practices to better support student success.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, my goal is to help students discover not only the “what” of scientific knowledge but also the “how” of thinking critically and creatively. 
            I see my role as a supportive mentor and facilitator—one who works alongside students to develop the skills they need to explore, innovate, and collaborate in an ever-changing world. 
            This humble, student-centered approach is at the heart of my commitment to lifelong learning, both for myself and for those I will have the privilege to teach.</p>

       <h3>Teaching Experience and Preparation</h3>

        <p>At the University of Cincinnati, I worked in a variety of teaching and tutoring roles through the Learning Center. 
            I tutored a broad range of mathematics, physics, and astronomy courses, including both non-major courses (e.g., Applied Calculus for Business and Engineering, introductory astronomy) and upper-level courses for majors (e.g., differential equations, abstract mathematics, Physics I and II covering mechanics and electromagnetism, and astronomy courses on the solar system, stars, and galaxies). 
            These experiences taught me how to adapt my teaching approach to meet the needs of students with very different backgrounds and goals—an adaptability I plan to carry forward into future courses.</p>

        <p>I also served as a Peer Leader, the sole instructor of a semester-long course designed to introduce first-year physics and astrophysics majors to professional development. 
            I planned lessons on resume building, communicating effectively with professors, and navigating research opportunities by inviting faculty to present their work and coaching students on how to approach potential mentors. 
            The course also emphasized strategies for academic success in majors with historically low completion rates, including collaborative learning and peer-to-peer problem-solving. 
            This role gave me valuable first-hand insight into lesson planning and the broader challenges of retention and persistence in STEM—insights that continue to shape my teaching philosophy.</p>

        <p>In addition, I served as a Supplemental Instructor for Physics I for non-majors, where I designed and led weekly problem-solving sessions outside of lecture. 
            I implemented collaborative strategies such as think–pair–share, jigsaw activities, and group discussions. 
            These methods helped students learn to work through concepts together and build confidence in applying physics to new situations, and they remain approaches I intend to use and refine in future classrooms.</p>

        <p>At the University of Virginia, I have continued to expand my teaching experience. I have taught observational astronomy labs, where students use telescopes during night sessions to explore the sky, track the motions of celestial bodies, and directly connect classroom concepts with real observations. 
            I have also mentored undergraduates by teaching them how to use version control tools such as GitHub for collaborative science projects. 
            In addition, I organized and led the Astro-Grad-Lunch for three years, a weekly seminar series in which graduate students shared their expertise on topics such as CV preparation, fellowship applications, computational methods, and supercomputer usage. 
            I facilitated the series and also presented sessions myself on GitHub and high-performance computing, fostering a supportive community of shared learning and professional growth. 
            These experiences have strengthened my confidence in designing lessons, mentoring diverse learners, and building inclusive communities of practice—skills I look forward to applying in formal teaching roles.</p>
